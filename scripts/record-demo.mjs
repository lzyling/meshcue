/* A workbench for pointing at surfaces cannot be explained in a paragraph. The
 * README described the loop in prose for as long as the repository was public
 * and never once showed it, which asks a stranger to imagine a three
 * dimensional interaction from a list of sentences.
 *
 * So the picture is recorded from the shipping application, by the same
 * machinery the browser suite uses: a real server, a real publish, real
 * Chromium driving the real interface. Nothing here is a mock-up or a drawing,
 * and that is the point — a promotional image of software that behaves
 * differently from the software is the same failure as a README that counts
 * its own tests wrong.
 *
 * It lives in scripts/ rather than tests/browser/ on purpose. The suite's case
 * count is asserted against the README, and a recording is not a test.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/record-demo.mjs   (needs ffmpeg for the GIF)
