/* Light or dark was decided entirely by `prefers-color-scheme`, and a media
   query is not something script can overrule. That is fine until the automatic
   answer is the wrong one — a dark room and a model that reads better light, or
   a system that reports a preference nobody set. So the page carries the
   decision on <html data-theme>, the system supplies it when nobody has chosen,
   and choosing writes it down.

   Resolving it before the interface is built matters: the alternative is one
   frame of the wrong theme on every load. */
