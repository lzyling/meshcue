// Every field a host tool context carries is optional in the host's own type
// declaration, so which ones MeshCue cannot work without is MeshCue's judgment
// to make, one field at a time, from what each one is used for. Requiring a
// field that only narrows something is how a host that supplies less context
// gets refused for no reason -- and a guard that merges several fields into one
// condition cannot say which one was missing, so the refusal misleads whoever
// reads it. This table is the single place that judgment lives: the guards, the
// inspect probe and the interface doc all derive from it.
//
// need "workspace" workspaceContext refuses without it
//      "owner"     who may change this review; every host must answer it
//      "route"     where a batch is delivered; only a host that can be pushed
//                  to has one, so this is a property of the adapter rather than
//                  of MeshCue. The branch in trustedOrigin decides for OpenClaw
//      null        optional; `absent` is what MeshCue does instead
