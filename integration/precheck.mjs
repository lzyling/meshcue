// mesh runs out of subdivision budget. That band belonged to the brush; with
// every tool marking whole source faces it costs a reviewer nothing, so the

// 1.0.0 — the hard limits are the only limits left.

// uses. Nothing here counts triangles independently: a second counter that
// disagreed with the server would be worse than no precheck at all.
