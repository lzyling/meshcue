// A notifier describes what a host offers, not what MeshCue requires. There are
// two capabilities and a host may have either, both or neither:
//
//   send(message, key)  push a batch into the conversation that owns it
//   observe(since)      read that conversation back to confirm it arrived
//
// A host with no send is not a broken host. Reached over a tool protocol there
// is no way to wake a conversation at all, so its Agent collects batches by
// asking — and a batch waiting to be collected must never be reported as a
// delivery that failed, because the page turns that into a standing alarm.
//
// A host with send but no observe is the honest common case: delivery is
// confirmed by the Agent acknowledging its read, not by MeshCue reading the
// conversation over the Agent's shoulder.
