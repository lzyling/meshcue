/* STEP arrives as exact surfaces; a viewer can only draw triangles. This turns
   one into the other, once, at import.

   The tessellation is the part worth being careful about. Marks anchor on
   `meshId` + face index (`server/index.mjs`), so the deflection that produced
   those indices is not a rendering preference — it is part of what a mark
   means. Recompute it later with a different value and every existing mark
   quietly moves to a different piece of the model. So the derived mesh is
   written beside the source, keyed by the source hash, and never recomputed;
   `importModel` reuses the file if it is already there. The parameters travel
   with it so a future reader can see what produced the indices rather than
   having to guess from the current defaults. */

/* The conversion happens in a process of its own, and the reason is memory
   rather than blocking.

   Both were measured on the heaviest real assembly here (73,132 faces, 8.9 s).
   A thread solves the blocking -- 3 ms of event-loop lag either way -- but the
   OCCT heap it leaves behind is not returned to the operating system when the
   thread exits: five conversions took a host from 58 MB to 417 MB of RSS and it
   stayed there. It is not proportional to the model. A 344-face plate costs the
   same ~240 MB, because the cost is instantiating the kernel in that process at
   all, once. A review server is long-lived and idles for 24 hours, so every
   project that ever published a STEP would sit on a quarter-gigabyte until
   someone restarted it.

   The same five conversions through a child process: 58 MB to 71 MB. The whole
   address space goes away with the process, which is the only thing that
   reliably gives those pages back.

   It is paid for in latency, and honestly: about 100 ms on the big assembly,
   but 1.2 s against a thread's 0.1-0.8 s on a small part, because a process
   reloads Node and recompiles the WASM every time. That cost lands on publish
   and precheck -- once per version, with the agent already waiting -- and what
   it buys is a review server that weighs the same after a STEP as before one.

   The answer comes back on a pipe of its own rather than on stdout, framed as
   a 4-byte length, that much JSON, then the mesh. stdout is where the parser
   prints its complaints about a malformed upload, and a frame sharing a stream
   with a library that can print is a frame that can be corrupted by one: the
   first malformed STEP through this code arrived as a JSON parse error on the
   word "ERR". stdout is discarded for that reason.

   stderr is not: the library prints its complaints to stdout, so what arrives
   on stderr is the child's own failure, and it is kept to say why a conversion
   died. It used
   to be discarded with stdout, and a vendored module loaded as the wrong kind
   came back as "stopped without an answer (exit 1)" and cost an hour. */
