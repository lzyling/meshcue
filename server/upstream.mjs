/* The only request this service ever makes to the internet.

   Everything else here is local by construction: the page is served from the
   bundle beside it, the agent arrives over a unix socket, and the reviewer's
   browser has never once been asked to fetch anything off-origin. That is worth
   keeping, so this is deliberately the narrowest thing that answers the
   question a reviewer actually has — is the copy I am looking at the current
   one — and nothing more.

   The reviewer's browser is still not the one going out. It polls the same
   `/api/state` it already polls, and the service answers from a value it
   refreshed on its own schedule. One machine asks, at most once every few
   hours, no matter how many people are marking. */
